            <p>Hi! It's so easy to distract yourself on the internet and to procrastinate. This extension allows you to choose to block the website page based on the keywords you don't want to see appearing.</p>
            <p>There are thousands of video games to play, news stories to read, video content to consume and so on. And often times this is what we do when the project deadline or exams are still far away. It's sometimes a bit hard to force yourself into doing what you need to do.</p>
            <p>And distractions are everywhere! Even if you use StayFocusd or Cold Turkey or FocusMe to block some websites by their URLs, you can't block everything. For example, even with ChatGPT, you could talk about the news or video games if you really don't feel like studying/doing some work.</p>
            <p>With this extension, you can block the websites based on words and phrases on their text.</p>
